“In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,\nDesiring this man's art and that man's scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\nFor thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.
